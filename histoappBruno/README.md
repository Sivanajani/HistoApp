# 🧪 API Test Collection – HistoApp (Bruno)

This folder contains test cases for the HistoApp backend, created using the open-source REST client [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/).  
They allow direct testing of the RESTful APIs without the need to build your own requests from scratch.

## 💡 What's inside?

The collection includes the following test cases:

- `GETCOMMENTS.bru` – Retrieve all comments from the database
- `POSTTAGS.bru` – Add new tags to an image instance
- `DELETECOMMENTS.bru` – Delete a comment by ID
- And more...

All requests are grouped by HTTP method and follow a structured naming convention.

## 🚀 How to use it?

1. Download [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) (available for Windows, macOS & Linux)
2. Open this folder (`histoappBruno`) in Bruno
3. Make sure your backend is running (e.g. via `localhost:8080`)
4. Run or modify any request as needed

⚠️ Make sure the endpoints match your backend config (e.g. port, path, auth token if needed).
